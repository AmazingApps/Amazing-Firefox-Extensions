This is an awesome list about Firefox extensions

Please note that plugins are not introduced here, read [this article](https://emlvirus.gitbooks.io/personal-knowledge-base/content/Info-Tech/add-ons.html) if you don't know how to distinguish.

Mozilla is going to drop `XUL/XPCOM/Mozilla SDK` used by legacy extensions, so extensions based on `WebExtension` are main contents here. There will also be continuous possibility here for legacy ones.

2. The extension has not been updated for a long time, and it is not clear whether it is still maintained.
